                    My favorate hobby is golf. I'm addictad to it. I first got into golf around 13 when I got a set of clubs for christmas. 
                    They were a nice set of Callaway Diablo Edges, and my favorate christmas present i've ever gotten.
                    Luckily, my family lived near a golf course in Oklahoma, so I found myself on christmas day walking out to an empty course hitting balls. 
                    I felt so proud to get my first set, I remember taking the extra time to clean them off after every time I played.
                    Nobody in my fammly golfs really, so I was able to beat my dad and older brother fairly consistantly even as the youngest child. 
                    And I can assure you it feels good to beat your older brother of 6 years in anything as a 13 year old. 
                    I practiced and played and took a few lessons at that age, and eventually found myself trying out for the high school golf team as a freshman. 
                    Because my name starts with 'A', I was in the first group to tee off in tryouts. This meant the entire golf team new and old was watching me tee off. 
                    I had never been so nervous in my life, and so I hooked the ball wide left out of bounds. 
                    After a few holes I did calm down however, play half decent, and secure a spot on the team. 
                    The most beatutiful and fun course i've gotten to play in my life was Torry Pines south. I shot an 85, and that will go down as one of the best days of my life. 
                    More recently in New York I haven't gotten to play much sadly. The lack of golf in the city is my one and only complaint of NYC. 
                    Right now im about a 10 handicap, but have strong ambitions to lower this to sub 5 once I move to a city more golfer friendly.

                    Around the same age I got my first golf clubs, my mom decided to take me on a vaycation out to California. Her oldest friend lives out there, his name is Nico. 
                    Nico is a cool guy. He owns his own engineering firm, and also several single engine airplanes.
